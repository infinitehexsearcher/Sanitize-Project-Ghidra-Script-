Launch Ghidra and open your project. Make sure the program you want to sanitize is loaded.

Open the Script Manager:
In Ghidra, go to Window > Script Manager to open the Script Manager.

Locate and Load the Script:
In the Script Manager, navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Select the script example.py.

Run the Script:
With the script selected, click the "Run" button in the Script Manager. The script will start executing.

Follow the Prompts:

The script will prompt you to select a directory where the sanitized project should be saved. Choose an appropriate directory and click "Select".
If prompted about including scripts, choose whether you want to include them in the sanitized project.
Completion:
Once the script completes, it will output messages indicating the progress and completion status.

Script Breakdown
Step-by-Step Execution
Script Initialization:

The script starts by printing "Script started."
Environment Check:

It checks if the script is running within Ghidra's GUI environment. If not, it exits.
Retrieve Current Program:

The script attempts to get the current program using the global currentProgram variable. If no program is loaded, it exits.
Prompt for Export Directory:

The script prompts the user to select a directory where the sanitized project will be saved.
Sanitize Project:

The script clears specific properties from the program:
Executable path and format.
User-specific properties like "Created By", "Creator Hostname", "Creator Tool", and "Tool Name".
Bookmarks that might contain user-specific information.
Analysis properties.
Other metadata such as "User Name", "User Email", and "User Organization".
Export Sanitized Project:

The script copies the entire project directory to the selected sanitized project directory.
Ensures project metadata is included by copying the .rep directory and project.prp file.
Prompts the user if they want to transfer scripts to the sanitized project.
Detailed Functionality
clearBookmarks():

Retrieves the bookmark manager.
Retrieves the monitor and categories from the bookmark manager.
Iterates through categories and bookmarks, removing each bookmark.
clearAnalysisProperties():

Retrieves and removes all analysis options.
clearOtherMetadata():

Retrieves and removes user-specific properties such as "User Name", "User Email", and "User Organization".
exportProject():

Determines the project name and constructs the path for the sanitized project.
Copies the entire project directory to the sanitized project directory.
Copies the .rep directory and project.prp file to ensure project metadata is included.
Prompts the user about including scripts and copies them if confirmed.

Post-Script Steps
Locate the Sanitized Project:

After the script completes, navigate to the directory you selected for the sanitized project.
Verify the Sanitized Project:

Ensure that the sanitized project contains all the necessary files, including the .rep directory and project.prp file.
Import the Sanitized Project:

To import the sanitized project into another Ghidra instance:
Create a new project in Ghidra.
Copy the contents of the sanitized project directory to the new project directory.
Open the new project in Ghidra.
By following these instructions, you can effectively sanitize and export a Ghidra project, making it easier to share and use in other environments without exposing sensitive user-specific information.
